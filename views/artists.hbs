He got his first tattoo at the early age of 14 on his wrist of his dog Leo who passed away that very summer. He went on learning more about tattoos since then which ended him up in one of the world’s best tattoo schools, the London Tattoo and Piercing Academy.</p>
                <p class="content1">For Martin, tattoo isn’t just a hobby, it’s his way of life, his way of expressing his thoughts. As for his specialization, Martin is a traditional guy. He specializes in Classic Americana, the fine blend of bold outline, similar colors and imagery&Portraiture- the realistic rendering of imageries, a genre he learned for Leo.</p>
